<h2>About me</h2>
    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>I attended <b>STA</b> (Saint Thomas Aquinas) high school and 
        graduated on the 
        <a href="#first class honor roll">first class honor roll.</a> After high school 
        I attended the <b>University of Toronto</b> while hoping to major 
        in economics.

         Unfortunately I could not find much passion in 
        what I was learning; so I returned home after my first year 
        and decided to take a gap year until I found my passion. 
   
        During my gap year; I was hired as a graphic design assistant. 
        This fortunately resparked my interest in schooling; as I then
        applied to <b>BCIT</b> for their graphic design program.

    <h3>Work Experience</h3>
     <p> During my gap year, I was worked for <b>Tap and Barrel</b> 
         as a host and expo runner for a total of 8 months.
  
        I eventually left that job as I was offered an opportunity 
        to work as a graphic design assistant for <b>House of Knives.</b>

        Since then; I have grown to take on more responsibility at my job;
        as I am now in charge of social media photography as well as 
        creating new web designs for upcoming promotions.  

    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p>I have a wide range of hobbies; but I would definitely put video 
        games near the top of that list. I love anything from small indie
        studios works to anything published by AAA game studios.

         I also love anything to do with technology! Anything and everything associated 
        with it; but mostly learning and staying up to date with the latest and greatest
        breakthroughs in tech. 
    </p>

    <h3>Music</h3>
    <p>Music is one of; if not <i>the</i> most important thing to me in life. It has been 
        such a helpful tool in all the highs and lows in my life; and I'm not quite sure 
        what I would do without it. Some of my favourite artists/bands include: <b>COIN,</b>
        <b>Twenty One Pilots,</b> and <b>The 1975.</b>
    </p>

    <h3>Achievements</h3>
    <p> In grade 11 I was selected amongst 120 of my classmates to read a speech 
        I had written to my entire school of 600 students. In that same year; I was 
        the first student in <b>STA</b> history to be a 3 time <b>BCTELA</b> awards winner.
        In both grades 11 and 12; I made the 
        <a name="first class honor roll"><b>first class honor roll</b></a> (93% or above average) 
        whilst being only one of three other students in my grade who were taking precalculus 
        the same year as taking calculus.  

    <h3>Philosophy</h3>
    <p>Despite being raised a catholic my whole life; I am athiest to my core.
        I always  struggled to believe in the concept of an omnipotent, all knowing
        "god." At least not in the way the bible described it. I did however like the idea
        that religions all have a moral way of thinking that guides how people live their lives.
        As a result; I became extremely interested in philosophy; and studied it extensively in
        toronto by taking 3 classes of it for my elective class choices. I seemeed to really latch
        onto the works of <b>Immanuel Kant</b> and his thoughts on what he described as the 
        <b>categorical imperative.</b>
